Testing Notes 11/22:

- Narrow down reactions/molecules of interest; may help simplify code and inputs. 
  These molecules will require MDV data to input:
	- Alanine (Pyruvate)
	- Glutamate (AKG)
	- Aspartate (OOA)
- import mfapy doesn't work in subfolders for me for some reason while using jupyter notebooks :/
- "Free" vs "Fixed" flux values (specified in csv input file)
	- a free flux changes within spec'd bounds
	- a fixed flux is spec'd and fixed
		- investigate whether we need to fix at least one flux value

- To-do for now:
	- get some MDV data to input
	- upload explanation .py file
	- get started on our code's GUI
